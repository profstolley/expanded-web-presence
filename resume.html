    Employment
Illinois Institute of Technology, Department of Humanities (8/2014-Present)
Research & Teaching Assistant
I am a teaching assistant for AAH 119, History of World Architecture, responsible for facilitating discussion among students, assisting with writing, recording attendance, grading, and other duties as they arise. I also assist with clerical/administrative duties in the Humanities department and serve as the book review editorial assistant for HOPOS Journal.

  <p>
    The University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL (4/2010-8/2014)
Journals Production Controller
I was responsible for the production of 12 academic journals (50+ issues per year total) across a variety of science and humanistic disciplines on monthly, quarterly, biannual, and annual schedules. These journals are both university-owned and professional association-owned publications. All journals are published in print, online, and e-book editions. This work required collaboration with a variety of parties, namely the authors, journal offices/managing editors, copy-editing staff, technical staff, and several different vendors. Manuscripts are entered into an in-house database once accepted by each journal and shepherded through editing, proofing, revision, typesetting, printing, and electronic presentation. Along the way I prepared electronic art for publication, kept track of the proofing and revision process, typeset and paginated individual issues, posted electronic editions including making edits to XML/HTML, performed quality control on online and e-book presentations, as well as gave final approval on hard proofs. All of my work was aided by a variety of commercial publishing software and in-house UNIX-based technology. I also performed technical checks on the LaTeX manuscript files and images for pre-acceptance astronomy manuscripts during the peer-review process similar to some aspects of my previous position at the Press (see below).

    Coe-Truman Technologies, Chicago IL (12/2009-4/2010)
Software Configuration Analyst
I was responsible for the setup and customization of proprietary software packages devoted to the organization and dissemination of information for large professional association meetings and conventions. Using the data entered into the software tools by event organizers I produced customized reports, web sites, print materials, and e-books for those organizing and attending the meetings.

  The University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL (5/2005-11/2008)
Web Peer Review Production Controller, Astronomy Journals Group
I was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the astronomy web peer review system for three American Astronomical Society journals. Using proprietary technology and commercially-available software, I resolved technical issues with the manuscript and graphics files of four separate astronomy journals. This included image manipulation and editing, editing LaTeX markup code, and handling large video files and animations. Most of the work involved pre-acceptance material and frequent contact/collaboration with authors, three separate journal editorial offices, copy editors, and production staff.

  Volunteering
Section 8 Chicago: The Independent Supporters’ Association for the Chicago Fire Soccer Club (s8c.org)
Director of Communications (2/2010-2/2013)
I served three years in an elected role on the board of directors for Section 8 Chicago, a registered 501(c)7 Illinois non-profit volunteer organization with an operating budget of over $200,000. Section 8 Chicago serves the interests of all fans and supporters of the Chicago Fire Soccer Club by organizing in-stadium support, road trips, tailgates, watch parties, and social events. In my capacity as Director of Communications I was responsible for producing electronic newsletters and web articles, making social media posts on Facebook and Twitter, producing and disseminating promotional materials, maintaining the organization’s web site (including transferring to a Wordpress CMS from a Joomla CMS), and also serving as liaison with media as well as the Chicago Fire Front Office’s communications staff.

  XI: A North American Soccer Quarterly (xiquarterly.com)
Copy Editor (2012-2013)
I copy edited several article manuscripts for each of the first 3 issues of XI Quarterly, a start-up journal dedicated to long-form North American soccer journalism. This editing work incorporates AP style, in contrast to my work in Chicago style. Articles are typically 8-12 pages in manuscript form and are edited for style and clarity. Some articles were written by authors whose first language is not English, which presented an interesting challenge.
